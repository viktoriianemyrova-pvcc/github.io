        <tr> <td> TERM </td><td> DEFINITION</td></tr>
    
        <tr> <td> Operating System </td> <td> The most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Job queue</td> <td> Contains an ordered list of jobs waiting to be processed by a subsystem. The job queue is the first place that a submitted batch job goes before becoming active in a subsystem. The job is held here until a number of factors are met.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> FIFO </td> <td> This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Interactive processing</td> <td> In an Interactive operating system, the user enters some command into the system and the work of the system is to execute it. Programs that allow users to enter some data or commands are known as Interactive Operating Systems.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Time-sharing </td><td>A method of allowing multiple individuals at different terminals to access the same computer system simultaneously.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Multiprograming </td> <td> A rudimentary form of parallel processing in which several programs run at the same time on a uniprocessor system. However, because there is only one processor, there is no true simultaneous execution of different programs.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Application Software</td> <td> An application, also referred to as an application program or application software, is a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application. An application can be self-contained or a group of programs.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Utility Software</td> <td> A specific category of System software that support a computer system in operating as safely and efficiently as possible. Utility software has the job of analysing, configuring, optimising, and maintaining a particular part of your computer system.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Graphical user interface (GUI)</td> <td> A graphics-based operating system interface that uses icons, menus and a mouse (to click on the icon or pull down the menus) to manage interaction with the system. Developed by Xerox, the GUI was popularized by the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Shell</td> <td> The outermost layer of the operating system. Shells incorporate a programming language to control processes and files, as well as to start and control other programs.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Kernel</td><td> The central module of an operating system. It is that part of an OS that loads first and remains in the main memory. Kernel examples are Zircon, Linux, WindowsNT, etc. Kernels are of five types, namely monolithic, microkernel, nanokernel, hybrid kernel, and exokernel.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Device Driver</td> <td>A driver, or device driver, is a set of files that tells a piece of hardware how to function by communicating with a computer's operating system. All pieces of hardware require a driver, from your internal computer components, such as your graphics card, to your external peripherals, like a printer.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> File Manager </td> <td> A system software responsible for the creation, deletion, modification of the files and managing their access, security and the resources used by them. These functions are performed in collaboration with the Device Manager. The File Manager has big responsibilities in it's hands.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Memory Manager</td><td> The process of coordinating and controlling the memory during a computer, Blocks are assigning portions that are assigned to varied running programs to optimize the general performance of the system.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Virtual Memory</td> <td> A method that computers use to manage storage space to keep systems running quickly and efficiently. Using the technique, operating systems can transfer data between different types of storage, such as random access memory (RAM), also known as main memory, and hard drive or solid-state disk storage.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Boot Strapping </td><td>The term bootstrap means to boot or to load a program into a computer using a much smaller initial program to load in the desired program.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>ROM </td><td>Read-only memory, or ROM, is a type of computer storage containing non-volatile, permanent data that, normally, can only be read, not written to. ROM contains the programming that allows a computer to start up or regenerate each time it is turned on.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Deadlock</td><td> A situation in which more than one process is blocked because it is holding a resource and also requires some resource that is acquired by some other process. The four necessary conditions for a deadlock situation are mutual exclusion, no preemption, hold and wait, and circular set.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Spooling</td><td>The temporary storage of data for use and execution by a device, program, or system is known as spooling. Data is sent to and stored in main memory or other volatile storage until it is requested by a program or computer for execution.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Super User (or administrator)</td><td>Superuser accounts are highly privileged accounts primarily used for administration by specialized IT employees. These users/accounts, sometimes also called "super admins", may have virtually unlimited privileges, or ownership, over a system. Superuser account privileges may allow: full read/write/ execute privileges.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) </td><td> A multi-step account login process that requires users to enter more information than just a password. For example, along with the password, users might be asked to enter a code sent to their email, answer a secret question, or scan a fingerprint.</td></tr>
