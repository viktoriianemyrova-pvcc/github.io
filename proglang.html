        <tr> <td> Machine language </td> <td> the language understood by a computer.   </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Debugging </td> <td> the process of finding and fixing errors or bugs in the source code of any software.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Assembler </td> <td> An assembler completes the task in two passes. It produces a machine code in form of mnemonics. It produces binary code in form of 0s and 1s. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Assembler language</td> <td> a type of low-level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Translator </td> <td>  a piece of software that handles the translation of source code into a form that can be executed by a processor. </td> </tr>
        <tr> <td> Compiler </td> <td> a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Interpreter </td> <td>  a program that directly executes the instructions in a high-level language, without converting it into machine code. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Cross-platform software </td> <td> a type of application / program / software that works on various operating systems or devices, which are often called platforms. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Natural language </td> <td> an ontology-assisted way of programming in terms of natural-language sentences, e.g. English. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Formal language </td> <td> All programming languages, like Java, C, and Python, are formal languages. The patterns of ones and zeros that make up the machine code of a processor also is a formal language. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Machine independence </td><td> code written in high-level programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. These languages are designed to be portable, meaning they can be easily compiled and run on different types of computers. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> High-level programming language </td> <td> designed to allow humans to write computer programs and interact with a computer system without having to have specific knowledge of the processor or hardware that the program will run on. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Object-oriented programming (OOP) </td> <td> a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Scripting language </td><td> a programming language that employs a high-level construct to interpret and execute one command at a time. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Data types: <dd> integer </dd> <dd> float </dd> <dd> string </dd> </td>
             <td> <ul>
                <li> numbers without a fractional component, and don't support decimal points. While some programming languages define these different types of numbers, others don't. For example, in C you need to store the number 3 as an integer ( int ), and 4.5 as a float ( float ). </li>
                <li> a function or reusable code in the Python programming language that converts values into floating point numbers. Floating point numbers are decimal values or fractional numbers like 133.5, 2897.11, and 3571.213, whereas real numbers like 56, 2, and 33 are called integers. </li>
                <li>  a data type used in programming, that is used to represent text rather than numbers. </li>

        </ul></td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Primitive data type  </td><td> Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. There are 8: boolean , byte , char , short , int , long , float and double . These types serve as the building blocks of data manipulation in Java. Such types serve only one purpose containing pure, simple values of a kind.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Data structure </td><td> a specific way of organizing data in a specialized format on a computer so that the information can be organized, processed, stored, and retrieved quickly and effectively. They are a means of handling information, rendering the data for easy use. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Phython collection data structures: <dd> list </dd> <dd> tuple </dd> <dd> set </dd> <dd> dictionary </dd> </td> 
        <td> <ul>
            <li> an abstract data type that describes a linear collection of data items in some order, in that each element occupies a specific position in the list. The order could be alphabetic or numeric or it could just be the order in which the list elements have been added. </li>
            <li> an ordered sequence of elements that is immutable, which means that the values within the tuple cannot be modified when the program is running. The elements of a tuple can be of different data types, e.g. a mix of strings and integers.</li>
            <li> a data structure that stores unique elements of the same type in a sorted order. Each value is a key, which means that we access each value using the value itself. With arrays, on the other hand, we access each value by its position in the container (the index). Accordingly, each value in a set must be unique.</li>
            <li> an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs. Each key, which must be unique, has an associated value. Typically, the keys in a dictionary must be simple types (such as integers or strings) while the values can be of any type.</li>
        </ul></td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Function </td><td>  "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Local variable </td><td> a variable that is only accessible within a specific part of a program. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Global variable </td><td> a variable that is declared outside any function and is accessible to all routines in our program.</td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Source program </td><td> a text file that contains instructions written in a high level language. It can not be executed (made to run) by a processor without some additional steps. A source program is also called a source file, source code, or sometimes, just source. </td></tr>
        <tr> <td> Object program </td><td> a computer program translated from the equivalent source program into machine language by the compiler or assembler.</td></tr>
